## My project

For my project, I will analyze data on colorectal cancers in Ethiopia, found online. 

## Execute the analysis

To execute the analysis, please cd into `info550project` and open R.

Run `renv::restore()` to synchronize package library.

Build the report by running 

``` bash
make report.html
```

from the project directory. 

This will create the output `Rmd/report.html`.
